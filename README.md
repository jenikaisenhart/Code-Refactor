# Code Refactor

A marketing agency has hired me to fix their website so that they have a
codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines. I did this by editing the existing code for the page.

## Optimizations

Some optimizations I made were some symantic HTML/CSS changes to make it easier to read in the HTML and style sheet. This way search engines would find my page easier by code refactroing.
This is how the web page looks the same and the code seems cleaner. 
  
## Lessons Learned

Some things I learned with this project is even though you may think you have finished or reviewed for the last time there is always more to review. I learned that coding can be a repeative and time consuming task but if you keep learning and trying new things you will advance through trial and error.
